# `finddupimgs`

A program for finding similar images (\[near\] duplicates) within a directory. It makes use of the `imagededup` Python library to find similar images and provides a simple interface using Tauri and Svelte.

Currently the application is in development and it is not yet ready for general use. Once the project is usable enough, instructions will be provided for how to use it.
